## Comments 

This is the start of a Content Mangement System. This assignment uses node.js, and MySQL to manage a company's employee's. Again, here is an assignment, that you think is simple enough. For the most part MySQL worked well with me. The most complicating thing was getting the id for the role and department from their names. Yet, it was accomplished. 

In futures apps more will be added including: managers, deleting departments, roles, and employees, utilizing budget of the department.
